# Student Guide
## Building from sources
TheBreakfastClub provides all the sources used in the project and you can compile your own project by simply cloning the entire repository using `git clone` command in Windows/OSX/Linux.

## Requirements
We recommend using Manjaro Linux and a proper folder to keep the sources organized. The following tools can be helpful while compiling your own project:
- **GNU Nano:** A very helpful terminal-based text editor for your PC/Laptop. You can install it by running `pacman -S nano` on Arch-Based distributions, `sudo apt install nano` on Debian-Based distributions and `sudo dnf install nano` on Fedora-Based distributions
- **LibreOffice Suite:** This is a free and open-source software that will help you to compile and edit word, excel, powerpoint and database documents.
- **GIMP:** This will help you to edit pictures/assets provided in source code.
- **Xjournal:** A simple pdf editor with really good functionality, works best if you have all the plugins/dependencies installed for this program to work. (Arch users can find it in the Arch User Repository, or casually called AUR)

# Licensing
The project is under the GNU General Public License. So, feel free to take any ideas. We believe in free and open-source information and that's why our project is open souce!
